## Description
Once identified, a cybersecurity risk requires an appropriate response. The implementation of a countermeasure or security control to reduce the risk to an acceptable level is known as risk mitigation, one of the four responses to risk. Security controls fall into five types: directive, preventative, detective, corrective, and recovery. Additionally, controls organize into three categories: administrative, physical, or technical. Implementation of specific controls may result in the reduction of multiple risks. Mitigation may also require the repeated application or slight modification to particular machines in a system.

A software tool could offer a means to organize mitigation options and procedures while also tracking derivations. First, there needs to be a taxonomy for security controls aligned to existing frameworks for classifying threats (e.g., NSAâ€™s Threat Framework). The software tool should allow for the input of security controls with data such as procedures, applicable system or software, and vulnerabilities addressed. The software tool should then allow for the querying of the database for known mitigation options and creating derivations (a.k.a forks). The software tool is akin to a GitHub for mitigations.

## Sprint Plans
##### Note: These plans are very much <ins>subject to change</ins> since this project is done in agile, and not completely planned from the start. These plans were also decided on in the [PID](Written%20Documents/Project%20Initiation%20Document%20-%20Michael%20Burke.pdf) before the project started.

### Sprint 0:
###### 3 February 2020
-	We meet with Mr. Resch and Mr. Munilla to discuss future sprints and prepare the Spring 1 product backlog

### Sprint 1:
###### 17 February 2020
-	Creating the basic framework for the website that will host the database
-	Create the ER diagram or the database

### Sprint 2:
###### 2 March 2020
-	Create the database and have procedures for searching, adding, and potentally forking done
- Connected the database to the web-interface
- Have searching completed on the web-interface

### Sprint 3:
###### 23 March 2020
- Finish procedures that have to deal with editing and deleting, along with anything that our sponsors wanted 
- Going over the website to change anything that our sponsor want and that needs to be refined
- Show that adding and forking work on the web-interface

### Sprint 4:
###### 6 April 2020
- Finishing most if not all web-interface and database code
- Show any new feature that sponsor have asked
- Show any touch up to pre existing features

### Sprint 5:
###### 20 April 2020
- Show finished product, going over everything and getting feedback on the finished product
- Talk about implementation of the product
