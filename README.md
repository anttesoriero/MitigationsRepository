# Mitigation's Repository
#### Team River Otters - Project O.P.R.A.H. - Operational Program for Risk Assessment and Handling
Software Engineering Project at Rowan University with Professor [Jack Myers](http://jackmyers.info), Spring 2020.

## Description
Once identified, a cybersecurity risk requires an appropriate response. The implementation of a countermeasure or security control to reduce the risk to an acceptable level is known as risk mitigation, one of the four responses to risk. Security controls fall into five types: directive, preventative, detective, corrective, and recovery. Additionally, controls organize into three categories: administrative, physical, or technical. Implementation of specific controls may result in the reduction of multiple risks. Mitigation may also require the repeated application or slight modification to particular machines in a system.

A software tool could offer a means to organize mitigation options and procedures while also tracking derivations. First, there needs to be a taxonomy for security controls aligned to existing frameworks for classifying threats (e.g., NSAâ€™s Threat Framework). The software tool should allow for the input of security controls with data such as procedures, applicable system or software, and vulnerabilities addressed. The software tool should then allow for the querying of the database for known mitigation options and creating derivations (a.k.a forks). The software tool is akin to a GitHub for mitigations.

## Sprint Plans
### Sprint 0:
###### 3 February 2020
-	We meet with sponsors to discuss future sprints and prepare the Spring 1 product backlog
### Sprint 1:
###### 17 February 2020
-	Creating the basic framework for the website that will host the database.
-	Implement GUIs for the users to search and adding to the database
### Sprint 2:
###### 2 March 2020
-	Finishing up the website by having separate pages for adding to a new or existing database
-	Staring working on the basic infrastructure for the database
### Sprint 3:
###### 23 March 2020
-	Testing the database to make sure commands work and that it can handle multiple task at once
-	Going over the website to change anything that our sponsor want and that needs to be refined
### Sprint 4:
###### 6 April 2020
-	Set up the connection between the web site and the database
-	Test simple command
### Sprint 5:
###### 20 April 2020
-	Testing all feature to make sure that everything is functional
-	Talk about implementation of the product
