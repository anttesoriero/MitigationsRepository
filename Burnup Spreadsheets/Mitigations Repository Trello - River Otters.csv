However, her mitigation and conditions are slightly different than the ones entered in the system - this necessitates making a copy of the existing record to edit as required for the needs of the system she is using.  This would function by bringing the user to the create new mitigation page, but with the fields pre-populated with the information from the mitigation that is being forked from.

new mitigation is properly linked to the originating one in the database
